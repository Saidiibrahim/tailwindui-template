Imagine you’ve got some hard-earned money and want to invest it in the stock market.
Being the savvy investor you are, you will only invest in companies that meet a particular standard.
You don’t want your money invested in mediocre companies.

Maybe you already have a [stock screening script](https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/build-your-own-stock-screener-in-3-minutes-df4ff7e461e5), but you decide an application is the way to go.
This article shows you how to do just that. You’ll learn to build a stock screener app in Python.

## High-Level Overview of the Stock Screening App
In this article, we’ll build a stock screening web app in Python that will allow us to find stocks
that meet our investment criteria.

To achieve this, we will use the following:

- `streamlit` — A Python web framework that will act as our frontend for the app.
- `Financial Modeling Prep’s API` — We will communicate with this API to get the data we need for our application.
- `requests` — allows us to send HTTP requests in Python easily. We’ll use this to communicate with the API.
- `pandas` — we’ll use this for data manipulation.

We should take a minute to think about the structure of the app.
Here’s the simple app we’re developing:

- The left column is where all the screening parameters
- The middle column will contain the results from our inputs
- Below the results, we’ll have a button to download the results

## Setting up your Working Environment
Before embarking on any project, it’s considered good practice to use virtual environments.
This helps isolate your dependencies and makes your project reproducible.

I prefer doing my Python projects in Pycharm. One of the reasons for this is that Pycharm automatically
creates a virtual environment for every new project you start ( unless you specifically ask it not to!).

For this article, I’m going to assume your IDE doesn’t do this for you. So, very quickly, here’s how you
would set up a virtual environment called venv inside your project’s directory, from the command line.

```$ python3 -m venv venv```

Now your project has a virtual environment, you need to activate it. Once activated, you should see the
name of your virtual environment (in brackets) before the dollar sign, as shown below.

```
$ source venv/bin/activate
(venv) $
```

Great. You’re now set to install the external packages needed for our project. Before that, however,

## Creating files

At this stage, we have created a virtual environment for our project and obtained the API key from Financial
Modeling Prep’s developer site. It’s time to build our app.

Our project is empty for now. Let’s do something about that. Create the files we’ll need for the app.
Here are the files we’ll be creating for the app:

- `main.py` — will house the code for the user interface.
- `secrets.toml` — this will hide/store our API credentials.
- `api_logic.py` — This will contain the logic for interacting with the Financial Modeling Prep API.

Let’s start creating these files, starting with the secrets.toml file. This file will reside inside a
directory called .streamlit (giving you a .streamlit/secrets.toml file path). Here’s how we create it:

```
(venv) $ mkdir .streamlit
(venv) $ touch secrets.toml
```

Store your API key inside the secrets.toml file.

```
[credentials]
key = "Your API Key Here"
```
We can simply retrieve our API by calling `st.secrets.api_credentials.key`.

With our API key safely stored, let’s create the other files we need for our app.
The file requests_logic.py is where we’ll query the API and return the result in a pandas DataFrame.

The main.py file is where our front-end logic will go. Streamlit comes pre-packed with many
widgets and layouts for us to use without any front-end experience.

```
(venv) $ touch main.py api_logic.py
```
## From pip install to hello world
The stage is now set for adding code to our files and finally building the app.
We’ll start by installing the packages we need for our app ( as revealed earlier in the article).
Install these packages from the command line one at a time calling `pip install package_name`.
For example, `pip install streamlit` will install the `streamlit` package.

Having installed Streamlit, it’s easy to get it up and running in your web browser.
From your command line, run the code below. This will spin up a hello world `Streamlit` app.

``` (venv) $ streamlit hello```

<Image src={helloWorld} alt="" />

Okay. We’re making progress. Let’s add some code to our files, starting with the `api_logic.py`
file. The code should be self-explanatory, but for the sake of clarification, it is also explained
in the module-level documentation, inside three double quotes (“”” ). Copy and paste the following code into
the `api_logic.py` file.

```python
"""

                      volmorethan: int = 10000, sector: str = "Technology", exchange: str = "NASDAQ",
                      dividendmorethan: int = 0, limit: int = 100) -> pd.DataFrame:

    # Set up the parameters dictionary
    params = {
        "marketCapMoreThan": "{}".format(marketcapmorethan),
        "betaLessThan": "{}".format(betalessthan),

    response = requests.get(api_url, params=params)
    data = response.json()
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    return df
```
## Why do we have two modules?

Before we add code to our main.py module, let’s think about why we have these two files in
the first place. We briefly touched on this in the module-level documentation of `api_logic.py`,
but let’s explore this further.

What we’re doing is separating the application into two modules — the application logic and
the business logic.

The business logic of our app is the core algorithms and functions that make our app unique.
These are elements of the app that would work just fine outside an interactive context[1].
In our stock screener application, the api_logic.py file contains our app’s business logic.

The application logic is what makes our app interactive[1]. This includes the overall structure
of the app, buttons, interactivity and so on. These components provide a user interface to
your business logic(i.e the frontend).

Separating the application logic and the business logic makes the application easier to maintain,
easier to decipher, and facilitates collaboration[1]. As Colin Fay reminds us in
his “Engineering Shiny” book:

**Long scripts are almost always synonymous with complexity when it comes to building software.**

Our app is almost finished. Let’s now complete the final module of our app — the front-end portion of the app.
Copy and paste this code into the `main.py` file.

```python
"""This module provides the frontend functionality to interacting with the fmp API.
This module communicates with the `api_logic` module and updates it based on the user inputs.
The user's inputs are sent to the api_logic module, and this module displays the results as a DataFrame.
Available Functions:
- stock_screener: Provides the user interface to the api_logic module.

# Download screening results
    @st.cache
    def convert_df(df):
        # IMPORTANT: Cache the conversion to prevent computation on every rerun
        return df.to_csv().encode('utf-8')

    csv = convert_df(results)

    st.download_button(
        label="Download data as CSV",
        data=csv,
        file_name='screener_data.csv',
        mime='text/csv',
    )


# Call the function with API credentials
stock_screener(my_api_key=st.secrets.api_credentials.key)
```

And that’s everything. To see the app you’ve created, run the following command:

```(venv) $ streamlit run main.py```
